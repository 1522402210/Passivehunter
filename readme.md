 # **What is PassiveHunter ?**
 Passivehunter uses https://dns.bufferover.run for enumerating subdomains , This project  uses the The Rapid7 [Project Sonar](https://opendata.rapid7.com/) datasets  . dns.bufferover.run uses DNSGrep for quickly searching the the large data sets , Passivehunter enumerates the subdomains using query `https://dns.bufferover.run/dns?q=<hostname>`. It uses some regex magic to filter out the subdomains from the raw json output , then all the alive subdomains are filtered. It shows the status code of the alive subdomains. It is fast as it uses `asynchronous` requests instead of traditional `synchronous` requests.

 # **Why PassiveHunter ?** 
 I created this for my personal use , as enumerating the subdomains and filtering out the alive subdomains among hundreds of domains is a tedious task and ofcourse not a programmer way of doing things , Passivehunter automates all this , from filtering out the domains from raw json output to removing all the dead domains , It helped me a lot in finding a lot of potential hidden assets of the BB companies (And yes a lot of $$$$ bounties too) . 

# **Compatability**
**It works on anything that has Python installed.**

# **How to install and use ?**

` > mkdir Passive-hunter`

`> cd Passive-hunter`

`> git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/Passivehunter`

`> sudo apt install python3.7 python3-venv python3.7-venv`

`> python3.7 -m venv py37-venv`

`> . py37-venv/bin/activate`

`> cd Passivehunter`

`> pip install -r requirements.txt` 

`> python passivehunter.py domainname.tld`


# Files :

When a scan is successfully completed , **3 files** are created 

`1 - domainname.txt : contains all domains dead + alive` 

`2 - domainname-200.txt : contains domains with 200 status` 

`3 - domainname-other.txt : contains domains with status other than 200. `


# Example Usage : 
python passivehunter.py hackerone.com
